## Introduction
This project is comprised of two main components:
1. A **Landing Page** that introduces the project, showcases key features, and provides an introduction to the team.
2. A **URL Shortener Web App** that allows users to input a long URL and receive a shortened version that redirects to the original URL.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two primary sections:
- **Landing Page**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, deployed on GitHub Pages.
- **URL Shortener Web App**: Built using Flask (Python), deployed on Render.

## Landing Page

The landing page serves as an introduction to the project. It explains the purpose of the URL shortener, highlights features, introduces team members, and contains a button that links to the deployed web app.

### Features
- **Intro Section**: Contains a cover image, project name, a brief description, and navigation elements.
- **Feature Section**: Highlights 3 key features of the URL shortener.
- **About Section**: Describes the inspiration for the project and links to the GitHub repo and team members' social profiles.

## URL Shortener Web App

The URL Shortener Web App allows users to shorten long URLs into compact URLs for easy sharing. Once a user enters a URL, the app generates a shortened version that redirects to the original URL.

### Features
- **URL Input**: Users can input a long URL to generate a short version.
- **Shortened URL Display**: The shortened URL is displayed to the user, and they can click to navigate to the original URL.
- **Simple Interface**: Minimalistic and easy-to-use interface.

### How It Works
1. **User Input**: The user submits a long URL through a form on the website.
2. **URL Shortening**: The web app generates a shortened URL (e.g., `http://short.ly/abc123`).
3. **Redirection**: When the shortened URL is visited, the user is redirected to the original URL.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Deployment**:
  - GitHub Pages for the landing page
  - Render for the web app
